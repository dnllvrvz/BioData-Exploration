# BioData-Exploration

This is repository holds the documentation of the BioData Exploration with arduino.

## Arduino Setup

Here's a picture of the initial circuit used for the collection of the data in this exploration. It has been inspired by [this project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ogMm94AH80) by Build It.

The only difference between this drawing and the actual setup that I have been using is that I have an Arduino Uno, instead of an Arduino Nano. But for the purpose of this project that doesn't change anything.

Here's a playlist where I explain the setup and show examples of its functioning: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgduvfqJa2lOS8xUoFPziR5fBI0N4Owao
